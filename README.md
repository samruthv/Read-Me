This repository is for a break down of my github subjects

## Projetcs:

Internship Demand Estimator:

Created a model the estimates the number of applicants for a job posting based on job location and industry. (MAE = 25.1 applications) Made Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest models to find the best fit. Using Flask made a client facing API that is AWS accessible.

NBA Player Clustering and Modeling

Simulated players by using clustering methods to analyze similar play styles, how good a player is, and determine if the traditional PPG, AST, and RPG are good ways to judge a player. Used regression models to grasp and predict a certain playerâ€™s game statistics.

ETF Quantitative Analysis

Dwelled deep into advanced statistical methods by analyzing ETF closing prices, gold value, crude oil value and Morgan Stanley stock. Performed random sampling, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, time series analysis and more to identify patterns in this market.

Netflix Movie Recommendation Comparison

This experiment aimed to test the most optimized recommendation methods by looking at two types of systems (K means clustering and SVD clustering) and, using an identical movie reviews dataset, test to see which system will provide a better and faster recommendation for a single user.

Movie Titles Hypothesis Testing

The objective of this project is to determine if there is a relationship between the rating of a title and which country it was made in. We use Chi-Squared hypothesis testing to capture an understating of cinema and TV show culture around the world.
