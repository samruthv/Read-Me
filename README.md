# Welcome to my GitHub!

Firstly, if you havent already done so, please go and check out by website to learn more about me.

This repository is for a break down of my github.

## Projetcs:

[Internship Demand Estimator](https://github.com/samruthv/Internship_Demand_Estimator):

Created a model the estimates the number of applicants for a job posting based on job location and industry. (MAE = 25.1 applications) Made Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest models to find the best fit. Using Flask made a client facing API that is AWS accessible.

[NBA Player Clustering and Modeling](https://github.com/samruthv/NBA_players_Clustering-Regression_Modeling):

Simulated players by using clustering methods to analyze similar play styles, how good a player is, and determine if the traditional PPG, AST, and RPG are good ways to judge a player. Used regression models to grasp and predict a certain playerâ€™s game statistics.

[ETF Quantitative Analysis](https://github.com/samruthv/Quantitative_Analysis_Project):

Dwelled deep into advanced statistical methods by analyzing ETF closing prices, gold value, crude oil value and Morgan Stanley stock. Performed random sampling, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, time series analysis and more to identify patterns in this market.

[Netflix Movie Recommendation Comparison](https://github.com/samruthv/Netflix_Movie_Recommendation_Project):

This experiment aimed to test the most optimized recommendation methods by looking at two types of systems (K means clustering and SVD clustering) and, using an identical movie reviews dataset, test to see which system will provide a better and faster recommendation for a single user.

[Movie Titles Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/samruthv/Movie_Titles_Hypothisis_Testing):

The objective of this project is to determine if there is a relationship between the rating of a title and which country it was made in. We use Chi-Squared hypothesis testing to capture an understating of cinema and TV show culture around the world. 

[Algorithmic_Trading_Strategy](https://github.com/samruthv/Algorithmic_Trading_Strategy):

*Work In Progress*

## School Programming Work:

### Numerical linear ALgebra:

[Wordbank_Matrix_Manipulation](https://github.com/samruthv/Wordbank_Matrix_Manipulation): Basic routines in NumPy and prepare you to manipulate image and tabular data. 
[SVD_Prediction_and_Compression](https://github.com/samruthv/SVD_Prediction_and_Compression): Applications of SVD   
[Regression_and_Classification](https://github.com/samruthv/Regression_and_Classification): Working with two real datasets to perform regression and classification as well as analyze the accuracy and other evaluation criteria for these tasks.  
[Principal_Component_Analysis](https://github.com/samruthv/Principal_Component_Analysis): Applications of PCA using ScikitLearn and NumPy packages. Using variety of Python packages for displaying informative plots, such as scree-plot, loading-plot, and score-plot.  
[Non-negative_matrix_factorization](https://github.com/samruthv/Non-negative_matrix_factorization): Applications of NMF in document modeling and image analysis by using ScikitLearn and NumPy packages for matrix decomposition.   
[Matrix_Representations_of_Graphs](https://github.com/samruthv/Matrix_Representations_of_Graphs): Graph based representation of data and analyze the matrices arising from these graphs to get insightful information from the data.  
[Matrix_Image_Manipulations_Kernalization](https://github.com/samruthv/Matrix_Image_Manipulations_Kernalization): Basic routines in NumPy and prepare you to manipulate image and tabular data. 
[Matrix_Calculus_and_Optimization](https://github.com/samruthv/Matrix_Calculus_and_Optimization):  Practice with numerical calculations of matrix derivatives and find approximate optimum values of functions by using iterative routines such as the gradient descent method.   
[Linear_Systems_and_Iterative_Solvers](https://github.com/samruthv/Linear_Systems_and_Iterative_Solvers): Modify Gaussian elimination methods for multiple tasks, among them finding PLU decomposition and finding determinants and inverses. You also implement iterative methods for solving linear systems.     
[K-Means_and_Spectral_Clustering_Predicting](https://github.com/samruthv/K-Means_and_Spectral_Clustering_Predicting): Implement some clustering methods   
[Eigenface_Image_Reconstruction](https://github.com/samruthv/Eigenface_Image_Reconstruction):  Solve some least square problems and verify certain properties of QR decomposition using NumPy.  


### Statistical methods:

[Hypothesis_Test_AVONA_Kruskal-Wallis](https://github.com/samruthv/Hypothesis_Test_AVONA_Kruskal-Wallis): The different uses of Parametric and Nonparametric Analysis.    
[OLS_Regression](https://github.com/samruthv/OLS_Regression): Using OLS regression to analyze and predict outcome of experiment weith 3 different runs.   
[Linear_Regression](https://github.com/samruthv/Linear_Regression): Linear Regression to measure difference and control of experiment. Determine how mean and medien value changes in test. See if it is appropriate to conduct a non-parametric test.  
[Chi_Squred_Hypothisis_Test](https://github.com/samruthv/Chi_Squred_Hypothisis_Test): Using hypothesis testing get P-value and reject or fail to reject hypothesis.
